    ["story_txt_361"]=" Hold this beach, men! We shall await reinforcements here.",
    ["story_txt_360"]="They've made landfall and are setting up camp. Allow me to ride out and welcome them ashore.",
    ["set.nolang"]="More languages are coming soon.",
    ["story_txt_369"]="You're right, Sir Oliver. We can hold this beach, but I also suspect this won't be their only angle of attack.",
    ["story_txt_368"]="We mustn't give up hope. This clearly isn't their entire fleet, so we still stand a chance of holding them back at this beach.",
    ["story_txt_367"]="That may be the case. Your father and the old king of Gilderwood were all that were holding them back. With them both gone, the realm is vulnerable.",
    ["story_txt_366"]="Blast them for picking this time to attack! Didn't the former king of Gilderwood take the fight to them? You don't suppose he lost, do you?",
    ["story_txt_365"]="A smart move. In the meantime, it remains up to us to hold this beach. We must shore up our fortifications before more ships make landfall.",

    ["story_txt_372"]="He's right, your Highness. We can't just keep throwing our men at them, we need a real attack plan or this beach will fall.",
    ["story_txt_371"]="Your attempts at defense are valiant but futile. For every soldier that falls, we have one hundred more coming!",
    ["story_txt_370"]="Are you saying we might be looking at a full invasion?! If that's the case, let's hurry and send these guys to the bottom of the sea!",

    ["story_txt_340"]="I'll talk, just keep that oaf away from me! He's got a ship at the coast to the south. He'll head there for sure and then sail east. He's got allies there.",

    ["story_txt_345"]="What's that to the south? There are more men marching this way to join up with the fleeing usurper's forces!",
    ["story_txt_344"]="I can't believe this nightmare is finally coming to an end.",
    ["story_txt_343"]="Caution, as always, your Highness. But also speed. We've come this far, the usurper must be brought to justice.",
