Albeit, the path to untold wealth is not an easy one to follow, the lords will must descend to the very bottom the haunted caves - the only place where thou could find everything you've longed for.\nAnd now, it’s your time to conquer and defend what belongs to you, my lord. Join our Halloween celebrations and fight for the greater will to achieve everything you've ever wanted.\n\n1. You will be randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 starting points on the map. This also happens when you are defeated in combat.\n2. You need to spend Magic Broomsticks to get to an adjacent building. Occupy a building and then enter the next one.\n3. Occupy buildings to produce the corresponding resources. You must manually collect resources while occupied, or you will lose a portion of the resources.\n4. If there is an empty slot in your building, it will be instantly occupied. Otherwise, you must defeat your opponent to retain the building.\n5. If it is under your occupation, you may attack other players' buildings. Defeating opponents will remove them from the building, and you will steal a portion of the resources. However, you cannot occupy multiple buildings.\n6. There are safe buildings across the map where players are forbidden to challenge each other. You can move to a building adjacent to a safe building without occupying the latter first.\n7. Each time you are defeated by another player while occupying a building, you will gain a 20% power increase (stacks 10 times).\n8. Power gains will last for 6 hours. This duration will refresh each time you are defeated in combat.\n9. Power gains are zeroed out upon every victory.\n10. Occupying a building will result in a 15 min. protection period. You cannot challenge other players during this time.\n11. You must use Bloody Fangs to challenge other players. You will lose a portion of your Evil Potions once the challenge is complete.\n12. Each challenge will cost a set amount of Evil Potions. If you do not have enough Evil Potions, you will be defeated.\n13. Resource production is calculated once per minute. If a minute has not passed, then the corresponding resources will not be calculated.\n14.The types and levels of spots on the map will change each day. You will automatically return to the starting point at 0:00 on the server each day, and any rewards not claimed during that time will need to be claimed manually.",
